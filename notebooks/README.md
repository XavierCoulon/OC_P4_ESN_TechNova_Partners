# Notebooks Directory Structure

This directory contains all Jupyter notebooks organized by purpose.

## Directory Organization

-   **`exploratory/`** - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks

    -   Initial data exploration
    -   Statistical analysis
    -   Data visualization
    -   Data quality assessment

-   **`modeling/`** - Machine learning and modeling notebooks

    -   Feature engineering
    -   Model training and evaluation
    -   Hyperparameter tuning
    -   Model comparison

-   **`reports/`** - Final analysis and reporting notebooks
    -   Clean, presentation-ready notebooks
    -   Final results and conclusions
    -   Executive summaries

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with numbers for ordering:

-   `01_initial_data_exploration.ipynb`
-   `02_data_cleaning.ipynb`
-   `03_feature_analysis.ipynb`
-   `01_baseline_models.ipynb`
-   `02_model_optimization.ipynb`

## Best Practices

-   Keep notebooks focused on a single task
-   Use markdown cells to document your analysis
-   Clear outputs before committing to git
-   Export key findings to the reports directory
