# Data Directory Structure

This directory contains all datasets used in the project.

## Directory Organization

-   **`raw/`** - Original, immutable datasets

    -   Store your original CSV files here
    -   Never modify files in this directory
    -   Examples: downloaded datasets, survey data, etc.

-   **`processed/`** - Cleaned and processed datasets

    -   Store datasets after cleaning, feature engineering, etc.
    -   These files are generated by your scripts

-   **`external/`** - External reference data
    -   Third-party datasets, lookup tables, etc.
    -   Data that doesn't change frequently

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with dates when relevant:

-   `customers_2024.csv`
-   `sales_data_raw_20240101.csv`
-   `processed_customer_features.csv`

## Notes

-   Keep datasets under version control if they're small (<100MB)
-   For large datasets, consider using Git LFS or external storage
-   Document data sources and processing steps in your notebooks
